# Neural-ODE-Ex
Exercise for implementing neural ODE

Backpropagation is not trivial is it is nice to go into the details of the implementation on how
the continuous backpropagation works.

Most of the code are copy and reference from Mikhail Surtsukov excellent blog post (https://msurtsukov.github.io/Neural-ODE/)

This repo is meant to be exercise for myself and the blog is for cleaning up question and detials of the implementation
